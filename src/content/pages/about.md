# About HeatSync Labs

Mesa's premier community hackerspace, fostering innovation and collaboration since 2009.

## Our Story

HeatSync Labs began as a grassroots effort to create a collaborative workspace where makers, artists, and technologists could come together to create, learn, and share knowledge. What started as a small group of passionate individuals has grown into Mesa's premier hackerspace.

As a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, we're member-owned and operated, ensuring that our community's needs always come first. Our 3,200 square foot facility houses everything from 3D printers and laser cutters to traditional woodworking and metalworking tools.

## Our Mission

To provide an open, inclusive environment where creativity and technical education thrive. We believe in the power of community-driven learning and the importance of hands-on experience in developing both technical skills and innovative thinking.
